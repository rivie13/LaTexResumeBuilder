# resume
LaTeX template for my personal resume

This is based off of Jake's Resume (I forked his repo) and Jake's resume is based off of [sb2nov/resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume/).

Use it on overleaf: [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) (Not updated)

Thank you to both of you for the great tool to use to improve my own resume.
