# resume
LaTeX template for my personal resume

This is based off of Jake's Resume (I forked his repo) and Jake's resume is based off of [sb2nov/resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume/).

Use it on overleaf: [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) (Not updated)

Thank you to both of you for the great tool to use to improve my own resume.

To use this for yourself:
go to [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) and download the correct version for your system.
install and restart after successful install.

fork and then clone this repo into an IDE of your choice. Make sure to add any extensions/packages to make
editing LaTex easier. Any of these that you like is fine.

After this do pip install pdflatex in your IDE's terminal

Change the resume.tex file with your information that you deem relevant.

After saving changes, go to terminal and type in: pdflatex resume.tex

A resume.pdf file should pop up which should be able to be used with any
job application you find.
